# SIMPLE

Open-Source Custom Imperative Programming Language. 
Designed for Education, Powered by Java.

## Introduction

The SIMPLE language was designed as an introduction to programming, a general purpose language supporting many of the core programming concepts without having confusing syntax or complex set up. Once familiar with SIMPLE, other popular imperative languages such as Java or C will become much easier to learn due to the sharing of common syntax and features. It combines the simplicity of its syntax with the sophistication and power of the Java language.

## Getting Started

As the SIMPLE language is interpreted by Java, make sure you have the latest version of Java installed.

The interpreter itself is a single Jar file however some test code is included as examples of possible programs. To run the interpreter, navigate to the folder in which the Jar is contained, and run the follow from a terminal/command line.

```java -jar simple.jar
```
You can also specify the SIMPLE code file to run straight from the command line.

```java -jar simple.jar Path/To/Code/File
```
Verbose mode can be turned on by specifying the command line argument ‘-v’ as shown below. 

```java -jar simple.jar -v
```
These are the only command line arguments available to the interpreter. They can be combined as follows.

```java -jar simple.jar -v Path/To/Code/File
```
